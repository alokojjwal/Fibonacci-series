# Fibonacci-series
This program is for Fibonacci series but a bit unique in nature.
# Uniqueness:
In a single program, one can choose whether he/she wants the series to be displayed or the value of the element present at a particular position of the series.
# Flow of the program:
Initially, it is asked regarding whether one wants to display the series or the positioned value. 
Then, either the number of terms to be displayed is to be input or the position number for the value is to be input. 
The program finally displays the output according to the need.
